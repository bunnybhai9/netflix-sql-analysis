# 🎬 Netflix SQL Analysis Project

This project uses SQL to explore a dataset of Netflix content. It answers real-world business questions using intermediate SQL functions such as `TO_DATE`, `REGEXP_REPLACE`, `STRING_TO_ARRAY`, `EXTRACT`, and more.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Analyze content types, genres, ratings, and countries
- Extract insights by actor, director, release year
- Handle text-based classification (e.g., "kill" and "violence")
- Use array functions for multi-valued fields like casts and genres
